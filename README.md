## HamBot
A little discord bot I work on in my spare time.

## Installation
To run the application, you'll need the latest version of Node.js installed on your machine.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Then, in order to properly connect with your chosen discord server, you'll have to set up the application and get its application key from the official discord developers site. 
- [Discord Developers](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/intro)

```
